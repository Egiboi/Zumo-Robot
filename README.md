# Zumo-Robot
A 1st year school project coding a Zumo Robot by Â©Daniel Eggleton, Jetro Saarti and Jalmari Espo

Program for sumo fighting other robots and a line following robot using sensors to run a track as fast as possible. Zumo robot uses ultrasound, gyro and reflector sensors. Robot data was sent to a MQTT client.

Sumo.c includes sumo fighting program which was my main area. 
Zumo_line_follower includes the race track code which was Jetro Saarti's main area.

Any bigger issues were dealt with as a team, with no main resposibility areas.
